    <p >Today is the anniversary of the publication of Robert Frost’s iconic poem “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,” a fact that spurred the Literary Hub office into a long conversation about their favorite poems, the most iconic poems written in English, and which poems we should all have already read (or at least be reading next). Turns out, despite frequent (false) claims that poetry is dead and/or irrelevant and/or boring, there are plenty of poems that have sunk deep into our collective consciousness as cultural icons. (What makes a poem iconic? For our purposes here, it’s primarily a matter of cultural ubiquity, though unimpeachable excellence helps any case.) So for those of you who were not present for our epic office argument, I have listed some of them here.

            Why use content marketing?
            For one thing, marketing today is impossible without great content.
            
            Content should be integrated into your marketing process, not treated as something separate. Quality content is part of all forms of marketing, including:
            
            Email marketing: Consistently great content trains your audience to anticipate, open and read emails from your brand.
            Social media marketing: Content strategy comes before your social media strategy.
            SEO: Search engines reward businesses that publish quality, consistent content.
            PR: Successful PR strategies should address issues readers care about, not their business.
            PPC: For PPC to work, you need great content behind it.
            Inbound marketing: Content is critical to driving inbound traffic and leads.
            Digital marketing: Content forms the foundation for an improved or rebooted integrated digital marketing strategy.
            Content strategy: Content strategy (which determines how content is created and managed throughout an organization) must be considered.

        NB that I limited myself to one poem per poet—which means that the impetus for this list actually gets bumped for the widely quoted (and misunderstood) “The Road Not Taken,” but so it goes. I also excluded book-length poems, because they’re really a different form. Finally, despite the headline, I’m sure there are many, many iconic poems out there that I’ve missed—so feel free to extend this list in the comments. But for now, happy reading (and re-reading):</p>

            Content marketing is a strategic marketing approach focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly defined audience — and, ultimately, to drive profitable customer action.
            
            Instead of pitching products or services, a strategic content-driven approach provides relevant and useful content to your prospects and customers to help them solve issues in their work (B2B content) or personal lives (B2C content).

                Here’s some advice from John Gonzalez, who leads social media content for Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District:
                
                
                 Why? Because it works.

                How does content marketing support the bottom line and customers’ needs?
                Wouldn’t it be great if your customers looked forward to receiving your marketing? What if when they received it (whether through print, email, social channels, your blog, or website), they spent time engaging with it? What if they anticipated it and shared it with their peers?
                
                Go back and read the definition one more time. Notice the phrase “relevant and valuable.” That’s the difference between strategic content and informational spam sent by companies trying to sell first rather than help first.
                
                When businesses create excellent content, they can expect one or more of these four benefits:
                
                Increased sales
                Cost savings
                Better customers who have more loyalty
                Content-driven revenue (i.e., content as a profit center)
                Content is the present – and future – of marketing
